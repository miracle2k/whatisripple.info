<h1>How Ripple Works</h1>

<p>
First, let's consider how an internet payment works today.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Here is Bob. Bob gives some money to PayPal. In exchange, PayPal gives him a
        <strong>balance in their system</strong> over that amount.

    <li>
        Alice is also a PayPal customer. Bob wants to pay Alice. PayPal takes some money
        from his balance and <strong>credits it to Alice's account</strong>.
        <img src="old2.png">

    <li>
        Bob also wants to pay Carol. Carol is French. PayPal will <strong>take USD</strong> from Bob
        and <strong>add EUR</strong> to Carol's account, applying <strong>PayPal's exchange rate</strong>.
        <img src="old3.png">

    <li>
        Brent is a Google Wallet user; he <strong>cannot exchange money</strong> with Bob, Alice or Carol.
        <img src="old4.png">
</ul>

<h2>Ripple</h2>

<p>
Ripple has a key distinction: it moves the balances to a decentralized network of computers, controlled not by any single institution, but by an open protocol - like the web.
</p>

    <p>
        Bob is now using Ripple. He choses a payment provider that operates on the Ripple network: Bitstamp.
        Bob gives money to Bitstamp. In exchange, they give him a balance over that amount.
    </p>
    <p>
        This time, his balance is <strong>stored on the Ripple network</strong>, decentralized and
        cryptographically secured. The network ensures that balances are safe and can only be modified
        by their owners. Even Bitstamp cannot access Bob's balance.
    </p>

    <p>
        Bob can now send money to Alice. Note that Alice <strong>never signed up with
        Bitstamp</strong>, and has no business relationship with them. She nevertheless can choose to receive
        Bob's money, and the Ripple network will credit her with a Bitstamp balance. Bitstamp cannot
        oppose this transaction; Bob and Alice may spend their balances as they wish.
    </p>

    <img src="ripple3.png">
    <p>
    There are many <strong>other payment providers</strong> on the Ripple network.</p>
    <p>
    Brent is a customer of Justcoin, and his Justcoin balance is
    stored on the Ripple network alongside the Bitstamp balances of Alice
    and Bob.
    </p>
    <p>
    Brent also wants to buy from Alice. However, Alice <strong>does not accept</strong>
    his Justcoin balance. She does not want to sign up with Justcoin to withdraw her money.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <img src="ripple4.png">
    <p>
    Bob does a lot of business with other Justcoin customers, and so he wouldn't mind a
    Justcoin balance. Because Bob agreed to this, the network will automatically transfer some
    of Bob's Bitstamp balance to Alice, in exchange for an equivalent Justcoin balance from Brent.
    </p>
    <p>Bob acted as an intermediary and <strong>facilitated a payment</strong> between Brent
        and Alice, and two <strong>different payment providers</strong>. He can choose to charge
        a small fee for this service.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because customers from different providers constantly want to send money between each
        other, there are many people like Bob on the network, and the market will keep the exchange
        fee low.
    </p>

    <p>
    Bob again needs to pay Carol in Euros. The network will convert his USD balance into a EUR balance
    using the <strong>best exchange rate available</strong> on the market.
    </p>
    <p>
    Bob could even pay with Bitcoin, his frequent flyer miles, or gift certificates. As long as
    someone on the network is willing to accept his currency, he'll be able to have them exchanged,
    automatically during the payment, for the Euros that Carol is asking for.
